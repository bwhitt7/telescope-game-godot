Hello! Welcome to Telescope Simulator.
Here, you will maintain and operate your very own telescope.
Every day you'll be given a list of stars to find and take pictures of.
The telescope will let you look at the night sky and take pictures of stars.
The computer will show you your list of targets, pictures you've taken, and save your progress.
The door lets you leave the observator and end the game.
